TextAlertView.*

This class provides for a UIAlertView with a plain text input.  It handles this by either messing about with the view hierarchy (iOS < 5.0), or by using [UIAlertView setAlertViewStyle:] (iOS >= 5.0).

This code was cribbed from somewhere, and then tweaked both to be more my style and to support iOS 5.0.  For the life of me, I don't know where I originally found it.
